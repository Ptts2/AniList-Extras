### Current Features

 - Adds character data from MyAnimeList since most of the time AniList does not have a complete character list.
 - Adds OP/ED data from MyAnimeList

### Installation

[**As simple as clicking this link**](https://github.com/pilar6195/AniList-Extras/raw/master/anilist-extras.user.js)

> If the above link just opens the file, it means your browser lacks a userscript manager. If that's the case then install one like TamperMonkey with the links provided below and then click on the above link again to finish the AniList Extras installation process.

#### Getting TamperMonkey

- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NBLGGH5162S)

### Usage

On the synopsis page of an anime you will be able to toggle between AniList and MAL character lists by clicking on the Characters header.

### Planned Features (maybe)

- Manga Support.
- Add indication on how to toggle between character lists.
- `/characters` support.
